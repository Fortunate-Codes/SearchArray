Explanation:

We create an array of integers and initialize it with some 
values.

We create two variables `largest` and `smallest` and 
initialize them with the first element of the array.

We use a `for` loop to iterate through each element of the 
array starting from the second element.

Inside the loop, we check if the current element is greater than 
the current value of `largest`. If it is, we update the value of 
`largest` to be the current element.

We then check if the current element is smaller than the 
current value of `smallest`. If it is, we update the value of 
`smallest` to be the current element.

After the loop ends, we print the values of `largest` and 
`smallest` using the `System.out.println()` method. We also 
include some descriptive text to indicate which value is which.

Note that we use the `Arrays` class from the `java.util` 
package to sort the array and find the largest and smallest 
values. However, this is not an efficient way to solve this 
problem as it takes O(n log n) time. The above solution takes 
O(n) time.
